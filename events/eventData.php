The motive behind this Neta App was to help citizens with the platform where they can give reviews to various politicians in their region and rate them on the basis of their work done in a particular city or state. This app is playing an important role for grading the politicians and getting to know about them. Additionally, it also tracks whether citizens giving reviews are authentic or not. In this way it provides us with unbiased results. The launching of Neta App was done in the presence of former president Shri Pranab Mukherjee. Various other delegates also joined this app launch. Chief minister of Delhi Sir Arvind Kejriwal, former chairman of BCCI, Sir Anurag Thakur and many more delegates were present.
